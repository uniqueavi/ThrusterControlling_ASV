# ThrusterControlling_ASV
An Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) has been configured which was having two hulls and two thrusters. It can be moved at a desired speed through the surface of the water and it can also change the directions depending upon the speed variations of both the thrusters.
# No Fins Concept
The ASV has no fins to change its direction. So, speed variation of the thruster came into the picture. I followed the methodology to keep the left thruster off and right thruster on, to help the ASV to turn left and vice versa. I have involved Arduino Uno as a logic board to simplify this operation and I integrated hardware PWMs to send the signals which will control the speed of the thrusters.
